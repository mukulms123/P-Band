# P-Band
We propose an air quality index system (P-Band) that allows us to monitor and check real time air quality index in our surroundings. P-Band uses air sensor (MQ135) to sense presence of harmful gases in the air and constantly transmit this data. The sensor interact with arduino which processes this data and transmit it over the application. Further the application interacts with online applets which keep record of the pollution level and also give alert via mail and message, when pollution index reach in dangerous level.
